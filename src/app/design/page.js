          Designing of the Library Learning Centre is guided by the DfE Output Specifications, local planning policy and pertinent British Standards. The general design philosophy focuses on the accessibility, flexibility, sustainability and integration with the existing school fabric. This design will help to make sure that the building satisfies the existing educational requirements and at the same time it can be modified when pedagogical and technological changes occur in the future (DfE, 2023).
